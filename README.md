# LearningDocumentation
A personal journal to document my learning of C++ and other computer related topics such as Computer Architecture.

## About me
 I am 14 years old looking to get into UC berkley. I have been using computers since I could speak and my life will be centered around them. I deeply love programming and troubleshooting and want a career in it. I am probably considered a gifted child as I have skipped 6th grade entirely, 9th grade math, and 10th grade computer science.


## My Story
	When I was younger I knew of my intelligence but didnt use its potential. I knew I could learn complex topics with ease but didnt take advantage of that. One day I was thinking about how many different things my dad knew, how much he would read, and his depth of knowledge. Then I realized that he didnt get this just by being smart but by using it.

	Then I compared myself to him and I saw how much time I was wasting. I would spend hours every day playing meaningless games and wasting my time. I was wasting my potential. I started trying to limit my gaming and spend more time learning but I just kept wasting more time. Then came the biggest realization "Everything was just a decision, and I could make the right one." Everything that was holding me back was just in my head. If I could just change that everything would work. I knew I loved computers already and now all I had to do was learn.


## Why im doing this
I made this to demonstrate my intellectual depth/growth even at this age.
